- 👋 Hi, I’m [@patrickkrebs](https://github.com/patrickkrebs/)
- 👀 I’m interested in visual development through code. I write all sorts of code on the fly, for whatever work I'm doing, usually in Houdini or Maya.
- 🌱 I would currently like to understand deep machine learning and Generative AI. The new AI revolution is fascinating to me and I'd like to know as much as I can about these tools, how they work, and how they can serve us in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything.
- 📫 How to reach me - Feel free to reach out to me here, or on Linkedin, or on X. I no longer use facebook.
